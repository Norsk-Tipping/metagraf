# metaGraf

metaGraf is a opinionated specification for describing a software 
component and what its requirements from the runtime environment are. 
The *mg*, the command, turns metaGraf specifications into Kubernetes
resources, supporting CI, CD and GitOps software delivery.

The specification takes inspiration from the <a href="https://12factor.net">twelve-factor app</a> 
methodology.  

## Installation

With Homebrew on macOS:
```bash
brew tap norsk-tipping/tap
brew install metagraf
```

## Status

This is a fork of https://github.com/laetho/metagraf. It contains releases tailored for the needs of Norsk-Tipping. Although we will try to stay in sync and contribute back to upstream, it might diverge from the original project in the future.
