Things to do:

* Consider adding readyness og liveliness checks to metaGraf spec.
* Consider detecting more advanced build modes, or adding structure to accomplish this. s2i base images from Dockerfile and BuildConfig on resulting.
* Design a way to generate buildconfig's with master->branch+pull request ci pattern.
* Add config type "envFrom". This will instruct the mg utility to map this in as a envFrom configMapRef for deployments.

done lately:
- Add an optional "global" boolean to metaGraf config struct. If true this will instruct the mg command to treat it as a globally named config. Defaults to false when not provided.
- Implement "global" parameter logic for configmap generation
- Implement "global" parameter logic for deploymentconfig generation
